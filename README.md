bored

bored is a game that let's the user decide what they're going to do to not be bored anymore, while also trying to not fall asleep. If your boredom can get to 0 before your sleepiness can get to 100, you win!

Every decision a user makes can have an impact on their experience. You land on the site and are asked what your name is. The name is updated and thrown into your dashboard where your scores are kept. You will notice that you have a cup of coffee. This coffee will save you once before falling asleep. Remember, playing games all night is fun, but it can definitely make you tired! 

Let's start with the random buttons. The random button to the right of the dashboard is innocent. It strictly generates random colors for the background. This button is harmless, be aware of other buttons that could be more harmful to you later! Not all buttons are fun and games. The second random button is the left knob of the sketch game. This knob has the ability to wreck you before you even realize it. It's a blackswan generator, meaning completely random events. If you're not prepared, they can send you into a slumber much like a bears hibernation. 

Enough of that, let's get to the games! You have three choices in this first edition of bored: Rock Paper Scissors, Etch-A-Sketch, and Future Value calculator (What's it take to be a millionare). 

Rock Paper Scissors is exactly what you think it is. You make a choice, and the computer generates a random choice. Your choices are compared and you either win, lose, or tie. If you win, your boredom goes down, if you lose, your sleepiness goes up. Pretty straight forward. In future editions it may be useful to make an AI who can start to figure out a players pattern of choices. 

Etch-A-Sketch is also exactly what you think is. Instead of twisting knobs though, you hover the mouse over the board and it draws a picture. The only way to have your score effected is by clicking on theleft knob and generating a random event. It will either lower your boredom, up your sleepiness, or change the color of the sketch board. Future editions will have the ability to clear the board while in the game. 

Last but not least, the Future Value Calculator. This is typically a tool used by personal finance obsessives or financial advisors to show clients or participants what the value of their investments will be in a number of years based on predicted levels of returns. It shows the true value of having time on your side, and that investing small amounts of money early and often can turn into some big numbers! Now what's this have to do with bored? When you enter values into the calculator, if they're less than 1,000,000 your sleepiness level goes up. Who cares about anything less than a million? If it's over, good for you. Use that knowledge to your advantage!

Below is the wireframe/initial white board for bored. As you can see, a lot has changed over here at the lab in Austin, TX. But, there is one thing it makes me think about. Derek Sivers in his book '_Anything You Want_' said, 'Journalists would ask, "What's your long-term goal for CD Baby?" I'd say, "I don't have one. I surpassed my goals long ago. I'm just trying to help musicians with whatever they need today'

You don't need grand visions to make something great. Hopefully this game makes you less bored.
